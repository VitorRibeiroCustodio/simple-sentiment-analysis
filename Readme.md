# Simple Sentiment analysis POC

  
**Objective:** Building a simple identifier of sentiments. Also, we should try different approaches to get the best possible result.

  
 
Requirements:

- pip install nltk==3.3

- nltk.download('twitter_samples')

- nltk.download('punkt')

- nltk.download('wordnet')

- nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')

- nltk.download('stopwords')


**TODO:**

 - [ ] Search for Samples in Portuguese

 - [ ] Use **Remove Noise** function or use a Normalizing the Data approach ?

 - [ ] Get stop words from Portuguese

 - [ ] Use samples with negative feelings, *e.g*, 'I don't hate you :)'  

 - [] Search for better classifier methods, for now we are using NaiveBayesClassifier.
